# Citation

A fast, stand-alone legal citation extractor.

Currently supports: 

* US Code
* US Public and Private Laws (slip laws)
* US Statutes at Large
* DC Code
* DC Register

## Install

[Install Node.js and NPM](http://nodejs.org/#download), then install Citation globally (may require `sudo`):

```bash
npm install -g citation
```

Or install it locally to a `node_modules` directory with `npm install citation`.

## Use

Citation can handle blocks of text, large or small, through the command line, HTTP, or directly in JavaScript.

Via the command line:

```bash
cite "pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(E) and"
```

Calling from JavaScript directly:

```javascript
Citation.find("pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(E) and")
```

Or through the included HTTP API:

```bash
cite-server
curl "http://localhost:3000/citation/find?text=pursuant+to+5+U.S.C.+552%28a%29%281%29%28E%29+and"
```

All of which yield:

```json
[{
  "match": "5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(E)",
  "type": "usc",
  "index": "0",
  "usc": {
    "title": "5",
    "section": "552",
    "subsections": ["a", "1", "E"],
    "id": "usc/5/552/a/1/E",
    "section_id": "usc/5/552"
  }
}]
```

(The HTTP API actually returns a JavaScript object with a key of `results` whose value is the above array.)

### Excerpts

Passing an `excerpt` option will include an excerpt in the response, with up to that number of characters on either side of each detected citation.

```javascript
Citation.find("that term in section 5362(5) of title 31, United States Code.", {excerpt: 10})
```

Yields:

```json
[{
  "match": "section 5362(5) of title 31",
  "excerpt": "t term in section 5362(5) of title 31, United S",
  ...
}]
```

Note: excerpt currently does not work when extracting case names.

## Command line

The shell command can accept a string to parse as an argument, through STDIN, or from a file. It can output results to STDOUT, or to a file.

```bash
cite "section 5362(5) of title 31"

echo "section 5362(5) of title 31" | cite

cite --input=in-file.txt --output=out-file.json
```

### Options

* `--input`: Filename to read text from
* `--output`: Filename to output text to
* `--pretty`: Prettify (indent) output
* `--types`: Limit citation types to a comma-separated list (e.g. "usc,law")

## HTTP API

Start the API on a given port (defaults to 3000):

```bash
cite-server [port]
```

GET or POST to `/citation/find` with a `text` parameter:

```bash    
curl http://localhost:3000/citation/find?text=5+U.S.C.+552%28a%29%281%29%28E%29

curl -XPOST "http://localhost:3000/citation/find" -d "text=5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(E)"
```

Will return the results of running Citation.find() on the block of text, under a `results` key:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "match": "5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(E)",
      "type": "usc",
      "index": "0",
      "usc": {
        "title": "5",
        "section": "552",
        "subsections": ["a", "1", "E"],
        "id": "usc/5/552/a/1/E",
        "section_id": "usc/5/552"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Options

* `text`: **required**, text to extract citations from.
* `callback`: a function name to use as a JSONP callback.
* `pretty`: prettify (indent) output.
* `options[excerpt]`: include excerpts with up to this many characters around it.
* `options[types]`: limit citation types to a comma-separated list (e.g. "usc,law")

Valid `types` are:

- `"cfr"`
- `"dc_code"`
- `"dc_law"`
- `"dc_register"`
- `"judicial"`
- `"law"`
- `"stat"`
- `"usc"`
- `"va_code"`

## Context-aware citation detection

In the JavaScript interface, you can pass optional `context`, an object with arbitrary key/value pairs, that can tell the citator what you already know about the source text, and potentially allow more permissive detection.

For example, most DC legal documents use the prefix "D.C. Official Code" before they cite the DC Code. But cross-references inside the DC Code to other parts of the DC Code do not include this prefix. If you know that your source text is the DC Code, you can detect cross-references by providing a `source` value of "dc_code":

```javascript
Citation.find("required under ยง 3-101.01(13)(e), the Commission shall perform the", {
  context: {
    dc_code: {source: "dc_code"}
  }
})
```

Yields:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "dc_code",
    "match": "ยง 3-101.01(13)(e)",
    "index": 15,

    "dc_code": {
      "id": "dc-code/3/101.01/13/e",
      "section_id": "dc-code/3/101.01",
      "title": "3",
      "section": "101.01",
      "subsections": ["13", "e"]
    }
  }
]
```
